# Work Day Scheduler 

Scheduler used for keeping your day organized. 

## Features
* Add tasks to your day by clicking on the box next to the time you'd like to add them. 
* Save your tasks by clicking the save button next to the edited item. It will only keep your changes until you refresh the page, if you don't save. 
* See the current date at the top of your schedule. 
* Automatically changes background around the task as the day goes on to let you know what your current task should be, what should be done, and what you should have left to do in the future.

## Potential Future Improvements
* Indicator to show whether edited data is saved or not.
* Someway to remove items on list without deleting data and saving. Too much hassle for average user.
* Maybe clear data when the day changes. Or at least allowing user to pick, if they'd prefer that setting so they aren't looking at old schedule that may mess up their day.
